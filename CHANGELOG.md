# Changelog

Here, the changes to `genomepy` will be summarized.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](http://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/).

## [Unreleased]

### Added
- Now using the UCSC rest API
- `genomepy search` now accepts taxonomy IDs
- `genomepy search` will now return taxonomy IDs and Accession numbers
- The README.txt will now store taxonomy IDs and Accession numbers
- Gene annotations:
    - Downloading of annotation file (BED/GTF/GFF3) from URL
    - Automatic search for annotation file (GTF/GFF3) in genome directory when downloading from URL
    - Option for URL provider to link to annotation file (to process is similarly to other providers)
    - Automatic annotation sanitizing (and skip sanitizing flag `-s` for `genomepy install`)
    - Option to only download annotation with `genomepy install -o`
- Plugins:
    - Blacklists are automatically unzipped.
    - Multithreading support for plugins, thanks to alienzj!
    - STAR now uses the annotation file for a (one-pass) splice-aware index

### Changed
- sizes no longer a plugin, but always gets executed
- `genomepy FUNCTION --help` texts expanded
- all genomepy classes exported when imported into Python
- all providers now let you know when they are downloading assembly information.
- more descriptive feedback to installing & many errors

### Removed
- Sizes plugin
- Old tests
- Removed outdated dependency `xmltodict`

### Fixed
- `genomepy config` options made more robust
- README.txt will no longer:
  - update 3x for each command
  - drop regex info
  - have duplicate lines

### Refactoring
- Genome class moved to `genome.py`
- Many functions moved to `utils.py`
- Many other functions made static methods of a class
- `Genome.track2fasta` and `Genome.get_random_sequence` optimized
- All Provider classes now store their genomes as a dict-in-dict, with the assembly name as key.
- Many Provider class functions now standardized. Many functions moved to from the daughter classes to the ProviderBase class.
- README.txt file generation and updating standardized
- Unit tests! all functions now have an individual test. Almost all test use functions already tested prior to them.
- Old tests incorporated in several extra tests (e01, e02, e03).
- Raise statements now use more fitting errors
- All instances of `os.remove` exchanged for `os.unlink`
- Almost all warnings fixed
- Extensive, COVID19-enabled, and somewhat pointless alphabetizing, optimizing and/or organizing changes to
    - imports everywhere
    - `.gitignore`
    - `.travis.yml`
    - `release_checklist.md`
    - `cli.py`
    - strings (many strings with .format() replaced with f-strings)

## [0.7.2] - 2019-03-31

### Fixed
- Fix minor issue with hg19 wrong blacklist url
- Ensembl downloads over http instead of https (release 99 no longer has https)

### Fixed
- STAR is not longer enabled by default

## [0.7.0] - 2019-11-18

### Added
- Direct downloading from url through url provider.
- Added `--force` flag. Files will no longer be overwritten by default.
- Provider specific options:
  - `--ensembl-version`: specify release version.
  - `--ensembl-toplevel`: by default, `genomepy install` will search for primary assemblies. 
  This flag will only download toplevel assemblies.
- Added STAR index plugin

### Changed
- Providers are now case-insensitive.
- Extended testing.
- Increased minimal Python version to 3.6.
- Removed gaps from plugins, added gaps to core functionality.

### Fixed
